# Robles-Bot

> Robles-Bot is a discord chat bot built using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and node.

This is a bot that I created to to mess around with my friends in our Discord server. Robles-Bot can do anything from play music from a YouTube link in your chat channel, to calling a phone and talking with text to speech. I will be adding more commands once I have more free time, but feel free to branch and contribute your own as well!

## Commands

- /ping - Replies with Pong!
- /roll - Rolls a dice with optional sides and count.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:AScriver/robles-bot.git
cd robles-bot
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

[How do I setup a bot account and invite it to my server?](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/discord.html)

Update `.env` with your `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `OWNER_ID`, and `GUILD_ID`.
